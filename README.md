# International HPC Summer School - GPU Performance Analysis

## Prerequisites

We will obtain profiling data on Bridges. The generated report files will then be visualized and analyzed locally on each participants notebook. This requires a local installation of NVIDIA Nsight Compute and NVIDIA Nsight Systems. Having an NVIDIA GPU is _not_ required.
You can either install the tools separately ([nsight compute](https://developer.nvidia.com/tools-overview/nsight-compute/get-started), [nsight systems](https://developer.nvidia.com/nsight-systems/get-started), might require a free NVIDIA developer account), or install the [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) which bundles both tools. In any case, please follow the instructions for the OS on you notebook.

A copy of all profiles obtained is also included in this repository.
